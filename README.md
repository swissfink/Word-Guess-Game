# Word-Guess-Game

## An app that runs in a browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

#### How to play:

The game uses key events to listen for the letters that players type.

1. To Start, players press any key twice.
2. A player scores a Win every time they guess the word correctly.
3. A player gets a Loss if they hit the limit of incorrect guesses.
   * If the word is `otter`, it displays like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _`.
   * As the user guesses the correct letters, it is revealed: `o t t _ r`.
4. The Number of Guesses Remaining: (This is the # of guesses remaining for the player).
5. Letters Already Guessed: (These are the letters the player has guessed, displayed like `l a q n`).
6. After the player wins/loses the game automatically chooses another word and allows the player play again.
